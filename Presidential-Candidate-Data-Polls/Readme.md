## About this project

This is a data engineering project I developed in mid 2022 prior to the 2023 Nigeria Presidential election. The aim is to build an online polling system that aggregates all the information and reviews of each presidential candidate and the overall sentiment of the election from online platforms like Twitter and Google news articles.
